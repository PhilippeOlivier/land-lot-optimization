"""Land lot optimization.

We have a lot of size 60Ã—40. We want to place up to 5 residential buildings (blue), up to 2 parking
lots (grey), and 1 park (green). There are two problematic areas on the lot. The first one (red) is
a floodable area, and nothing can be built there. The second one (orange) is a utility pole: we
cannot build a residential building there nor have it in the park, but we are allowed to build a
parking lot around it. The size of the park must be at least as large as the largest residential
building. The combined area of the parking lots must be at least 10% of the combined area of the
residential buildings. We want to generate a 2D plan that maximizes the yield of this lot, which is
the combined area of the residential buildings.
